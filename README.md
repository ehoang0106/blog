# Personal Blog

This repository contains my personal blog where I showcase my featured projects. 

The website is built with [Hexo](https://hexo.io/) and uses the [`cactus`](https://github.com/probberechts/hexo-theme-cactus) theme. 

A GitHub workflow is configured to automatically build the website and deploy it to my S3 bucket for AWS hosting.
