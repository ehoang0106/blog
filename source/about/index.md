# About me

Welcome to my blog! 

I’m Khoa Hoang, an AWS Certified Solutions Architect Associate, dedicated to transitioning into a cloud engineering role.

This blog is my very first “serverless” project. I’ll be documenting my journey in the cloud, sharing everything from innovative ideas that inspire me to the creative approaches I try to make them work.

Thanks for stopping by! Let’s dive into the cloud together, and who knows? We might even discover some hidden gems along the way!
