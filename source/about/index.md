# About me

![image](https://s3.amazonaws.com/blog.khoah.net/images/ava.jpg)

Welcome to my blog! 

I’m Khoa Hoang, an AWS Certified Solutions Architect Associate and IT Analyst, dedicated to transitioning into a cloud engineering role.

This blog is my very first “serverless” project. I will be documenting my journey in cloud computing, sharing both innovative ideas that inspire me and the creative methods I use to implement them successfully.

Thanks for stopping by! Let’s dive into the cloud together, and who knows? We might even discover some hidden gems along the way!
