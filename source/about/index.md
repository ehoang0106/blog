Welcome to my blog! 
I’m Khoa Hoang, an AWS Certified Solutions Architect Associate on a mission to escape the mundane and become a cloud engineer.

This blog is my very first “serverless” project (which sounds cool until you realize I’m just avoiding real servers). I’ll be chronicling my escapades in the cloud, sharing everything from wild ideas that pop into my head to the amusing ways I try to make them work.

Thanks for stopping by! Let’s dive into the cloud together, and who knows? We might even discover some hidden gems along the way!
