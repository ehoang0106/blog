Frustrated with TeamViewer’s restrictions and TightVNC’s limitations, I found RustDesk—the perfect remote desktop solution for accessing my MacBook and Ubuntu server.

What I love about RustDesk is that it's open-source, works across Linux, Windows, and macOS, and even lets you host your own server for more control.

So, I figured—why not take this as a chance to set up my own RustDesk server while also learning Ansible for automation, sharpening my Terraform skills, and getting deeper into AWS?
