Cybersecurity isn't just for enterprises - it's essential for home labs and personal IT setup too. I found Wazuh - a powerful an open-source SEIM and XDR platform that provides threat detection, log analysis, and system monitoring.

So I decided to setup Wazuh at home, using my Raspberry Pi to host the server, and deploying agents to my PC, laptop, and other servers as well.
