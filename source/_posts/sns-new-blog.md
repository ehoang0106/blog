Continuing my cloud journey, Iâ€™ve developed a new project that allows readers to subscribe to my blog via email. For this, I utilized several AWS services, including SNS, Lambda, API Gateway, Route 53, and S3 Events.

The project involves two main components. First, I created a Lambda function that triggers SNS notifications whenever I publish a new post on my static website hosted on S3.


The second component is another Lambda function integrated with API Gateway, which handles subscription confirmations to the SNS topic. Additionally, I set up a custom domain using API Gateway and Route 53 to manage the DNS records for my new domain.
