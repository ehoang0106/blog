As a renter, I have to rely on my host’s network, meaning I can’t configure the router or forward ports. Despite this, I run a Raspberry Pi at home to host several servers and manage some Discord bots. The problem? Every time I needed to update code or tweak something, I had to physically be at home. That wasn’t practical.

Then I found Cloudflare Tunnel—a game-changer, it's like spark in the darkness for me. It lets me access my Raspberry Pi from anywhere without worrying about open ports, dynamic IPs, or exposing my network to potential threats. Now, whether I’m at a coffee shop or on my phone, I can SSH into my Pi effortlessly.

## Why Cloudflare Tunnel?

Cloudflare Tunnel provides a secure way to access services running on your local network. Unlike traditional port forwarding, it eliminates the need to open ports, reducing security risks. Here’s why it’s ideal:

- **No port forwarding** – Works without access to the router.
- **Secure & encrypted** – No exposed ports, reducing attack risks.
- **Works anywhere** – Connect from any device, even on mobile.
- **Simple setup** – No need for complex firewall rules or VPNs.

## How It Works (Quick Overview)

Cloudflare Tunnel runs a lightweight daemon (`cloudflared`) on your Raspberry Pi, which establishes an outbound connection to Cloudflare. This tunnel creates a secure link between your device and a Cloudflare-managed domain, allowing you to access your Pi without exposing it directly to the internet.

Here’s a simplified setup:
1. Install Cloudflare Tunnel (`cloudflared`) on your Raspberry Pi.
2. Authenticate with Cloudflare and create a tunnel.
3. Configure the tunnel to forward SSH traffic.
4. Enable Cloudflare Access to add an extra security layer (optional but recommended).
5. Connect remotely via SSH using the Cloudflare-provided hostname.
